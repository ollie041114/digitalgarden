If you get lost at any time, or just want to explore what else Obsidian can do, `Ctrl/Cmd-P` brings up the Command Palette. You can type commands there, like "Navigate back", and you'll see options filter to a short list, along with hotkey shortcuts if they have them.

At base, Obsidian is a tool for working with a bunch of markdown files that are stored on your computer. If you're not familiar with markdown, it's just plain text with some formatting that makes it powerful (for more on that, see [Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes)) . As a result, if you want to use obsidian for keeping regular notes on just about anything, it will work great.

Let's say you want to write a note about your favorite band. Just type the name of the note surrounded by two square brackets, like [[My Favorite Band\|My Favorite Band]]
```js
function add = () => {
	console.log(this.context);
}
```
